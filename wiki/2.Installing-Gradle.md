## Installing Gradle

### Windows

- Go to the [Gradle website](https://gradle.org/releases/).
- On the page, locate the section for `v7.4.x`.
- Download the **Binary-only** distribution.

Create a directory named "Gradle" on your `C:\` drive and extract the contents of the `gradle-7.4.x` archive into it. The folder structure should resemble the following screenshot:

![Gradle Directory]()

Set up environment variables:

1. Right-click on the "My Computer" icon on your desktop and select "Properties" from the menu.
2. At the bottom of the page, select "Advanced System Settings."
3. Click on "Environment Variables."
4. Under the "System Variables" section, select the `Path` variable and click "Edit."
5. In the "Edit Environment Variable" window, click "New."
6. Enter the path `C:\Gradle\bin` in the newly created row.
7. Click "OK."
8. Click "OK" again.

> **Note:** The following steps (installing IntelliJ IDEA and Git) will also require a computer restart. If you prefer not to restart your computer multiple times, you can skip steps 8 and 9 and proceed to [the next step (installing IntelliJ IDEA)]().

9. Restart your computer to apply the changes.
10. Verify that Gradle is installed by opening the terminal and running the command `gradle -v`.

### macOS

1. Check for the presence of Gradle: Open the terminal and type `gradle --version`.
   If the system displays the Gradle version, such as `Gradle 7.4.x`, proceed to [the next step (installing IntelliJ IDEA)](). Otherwise, continue with the instructions below.

2. Install Gradle: Open the terminal and run the command `brew install gradle@6`. If the system doesn't recognize the `brew` command (package manager), you need to install it first. You can install Homebrew from [here](https://brew.sh). Once installed, close the terminal.

> If you encounter an error like `zsh: command not found: brew` or similar after installing Brew, you can resolve it as follows:
> - Run the command `echo 'eval $(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)' >> /Users/$USER/.zprofile`.
> - Then run `eval $(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)`.

3. Verify the correctness of the installation: Open the terminal again and run the command `gradle --version`. Ensure that the system displays the installed Gradle version.

4. Proceed to [the next step (installing Git)]().
