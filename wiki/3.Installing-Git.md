### macOS

1. Check for the presence of Git: Open the terminal and type `git --version`.
   If the system displays the Git version, such as `git version 2.34.1`, proceed to [the next step (installing IntelliJ IDEA)](). Otherwise, continue with the instructions below.

2. Install Git: Open the terminal and run the command `brew install git`. If the system doesn't recognize the `brew` command (package manager), you need to install it first. You can install Homebrew from [here](https://brew.sh). Once installed, close the terminal.

> If you encounter an error like `zsh: command not found: brew` or similar after installing Brew, you can resolve it as follows:
> - Run the command `echo 'eval $(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)' >> /Users/$USER/.zprofile`.
> - Then run `eval $(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)`.

3. Verify the correctness of the installation: Open the terminal again and run the command `git --version`. Ensure that the system displays the installed Git version.

4. Proceed to [the next step (installing IntelliJ IDEA)]().
